			<h1>Hello, I'm James.</h1>
			
			<p class="intro">

				I'm an embedded software developer and electronic engineer from Nottingham. Here's a list of things I can do:

				<ul>
					<li>Embedded software development on Arduinos, Arduino-like boards, ARM microcontrollers etc. </li>
					<li>Schematic and PCB design - fairly complex boards like 4-layer switchmode power supply boards</li>
					<li>Python programming/scripting</li>
					<li>Basic web development using the Flask framework (familiar with AJAX/Bootstrap/jQuery)</li>
					<li>Basic Android app development</li>
					<li>VBA programming for Microsoft Word/Excel/Access</li>
					<li>Advice/consulting/chat about all the above, often for free!</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Here's <a href="work/JFowkesCurriculumVitae.pdf">my CV</a> (PDF format).
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently I work part-time for <a href="http://www.g2innovation.co.uk">G2 Innovation</a> and spend the rest of my work time freelancing. Keep reading to see some of the work I've done/am doing. If you think I could be useful to you, send me an email (jamesfowkes@gmail.com) and we'll have a chat.

						<a href="http://www.justaddsharks.com">Just Add Sharks</a> sell laser cutters. They asked me to design and layout a PCB to allow use of alternative controllers than the standard one normally built into the machine.
					<p>
					<p>
						After producing an initial board, I corresponded with Martin by email to finalise the board, paying particular attention to the design of the silkscreen for both aesthetic appeal and ease of installation in a laser cutter.

					<h3>Coin Acceptor</h3>	
					<p>
						<a href="http://vintagebooth.me">Vintage Booth</a> run vintage photo booths. I was asked to incoporate a coin acceptor into the mechanism to allow payment on a per-photo basis. A standard Arduino was used to read the coin acceptor output and interface with the rest of the photobooth hardware.
					</p>

					<h3>USB Buttons</h3>
					<p>
						I was also asked to provide some hardware for use as buttons for the photobooth - sending a spacebar press to a PC when a button was pressed. The client had used other USB boards but found that they were not rugged enough to stand up to continued use. I was asked to design a solution with an appropriate USB board, plus strain relief and mounting, to ensure reliable operation of the booth.

						I have worked on several projects for <a href="http://www.re-innovation.co.uk">Re-Innovation</a>, designing PCBs and writing embedded software. The main project has been a datalogging unit for a photovoltaic system. The unit's features include remote datalogging over GPRS, local datalogging to SD card, configuration by human-readable text files (on SD card), SMS alerts and GPS positioning. All the high level software layers were developed to be platform agnostic. This allows re-use of those modules with other hardware platforms and also means the modules can be supported by a unit test suite that can be run without needing actual hardware.

						<a href="http://nsccreative.com">NSC Creative</a> asked me to add a feature to an existing installation, to allow a use case that was not anticipated in the original design. This meant there were limited inputs available to activate the new software mode. I worked with Gareth from NSC Creative to find a software solution that met the new requirements without affecting the existing features.
